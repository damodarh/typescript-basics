# TypeScript Intro

This repository maintains code for typescript and its features. 
I will be covering the basics of typescript here.

Topics covered include:
1. Hello world program
2. tsconfig.json and its creation
3. Data types
4. Functions
5. Interface
6. Classes

Folder structure:

src: holds all the .ts files
dist: hold teh output .js files that are emitted by the typescript compiler. FYI, the process is known as transpiling.
